# CypressTestGenerator
A tool designed to streamline the process of creating Cypress tests. Define test scenarios using a simplified, high-level syntax. These definitions are then automatically converted into executable Cypress test scripts. This approach not only speeds up the test creation process but also makes the tests easier to read and maintain.
