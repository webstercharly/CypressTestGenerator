# CypressTestGenerator

## Overview
CypressTestGenerator is a tool designed to streamline the process of creating Cypress tests. It allows developers and QA engineers to define test scenarios using a simplified, high-level syntax. These definitions are then automatically converted into executable Cypress test scripts. This approach not only speeds up the test creation process but also makes the tests easier to read and maintain.

## Features
- **Simplified Test Definition**: Write tests in a human-readable format.
- **Dynamic Test Generation**: Automatically convert scenarios into Cypress code.
- **Flexible Scenario Handling**: Support for various actions and assertions to cover a wide range of test cases.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Define your test scenarios in a `.ts` file using the provided syntax.
4. Run the generator script to produce your Cypress test files.
5. Execute the generated tests with Cypress.

## Usage
Detailed instructions on defining scenarios and running the generator can be found in the [Usage Guide](/docs/usage.md).
