# Usage Guidelines

To incorporate instructions for editing the scenario object inside the `generateCypressTest.ts` file into the usage guide, I'll add a section that explains how users can define their test scenarios. This guidance is based on the assumption that the `generateCypressTest.ts` file contains an editable scenario object or function where users can input their specific test cases.

## Editing Test Scenarios

Before running the generator script, you'll need to define your test scenarios. Here's how to edit the scenario object inside the `generateCypressTest.ts` file:

1. **Open `generateCypressTest.ts`**: Locate and open the `generateCypressTest.ts` file in your project directory.

2. **Locate the Scenario Definition**: Within the file, find the scenario definition section. This might be an object, array, or function call where you define the steps of your test scenario. It typically looks like this (example provided for illustrative purposes):

   ```typescript
   const scenarios = [
     {
       description: "Test Login Functionality",
       steps: [
         { action: "navigate", url: "https://example.com/login" },
         { action: "type", selector: "#username", value: "testuser" },
         { action: "type", selector: "#password", value: "password" },
         { action: "click", selector: "#submit" },
         { action: "assert", selector: "#loginSuccess", expected: "visible" },
       ],
     },
   ];
   ```

3. **Edit Your Scenarios**: Modify the existing scenario or add new ones according to your testing requirements. Each scenario should outline the steps to be performed during the test, such as navigating to a page, entering text, clicking buttons, and making assertions about the state of the application.

4. **Save Your Changes**: After editing or adding your scenarios, save the file.

## Compiling and Running the Generator

After editing your test scenarios, follow the steps outlined in the previous sections to compile your TypeScript code and run the generator script:

1. Compile TypeScript to JavaScript:

   ```bash
   npm run tsc
   ```

2. Run the generator to create your Cypress test files:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Tips for Writing Scenarios

- **Be Specific**: Clearly define the actions and expectations for each step to ensure your tests are precise and understandable.
- **Use Comments**: Add comments to your scenario definitions to explain complex steps or logic, making your tests easier to maintain and understand by others.
- **Review Cypress Documentation**: For complex interactions or assertions, refer to the [Cypress documentation](https://docs.cypress.io) for guidance on commands and best practices.

By following these instructions, you can easily define and edit test scenarios for your application, leveraging the power of Cypress and your scenario generator to streamline test creation.
